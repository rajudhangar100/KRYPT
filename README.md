# 🚀 CryptoExchange DApp

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve built and deployed a **blockchain-based CryptoExchange DApp**, allowing users to seamlessly send **Ether (ETH)** using their **MetaMask wallet** and track all their transactions on the blockchain.

## 🔹 Key Features:
✅ **Secure & Transparent** transactions on the **Sepolia test network**  
✅ **MetaMask Integration** – Users can connect their wallet and start transacting  
✅ **Real-time Transaction History** – View all transactions directly on the DApp  
✅ **Seamless UI** – Built with **React.js** and **Ethers.js** for smooth blockchain interaction  
✅ **Deployed on Vercel** – Anyone can access and use it  

## 💡 Learning Experience
This journey has been an incredible learning experience, from **writing and deploying smart contracts** to integrating them with the frontend and understanding **blockchain fundamentals**. The complete project, including the **frontend and smart contract code**, is now live on **GitHub**.

## 🚀 Live Demo & Source Code
👉 **Live DApp:** (https://krypt-5hsx.vercel.app/)  
👉 **GitHub Repo:** (https://github.com/rajudhangar100/KRYPT)  

## 📜 Technologies Used
- **Solidity** – For writing smart contracts  
- **Hardhat** – For smart contract development & deployment  
- **React.js** – For building the frontend  
- **Ethers.js** – For interacting with the blockchain  
- **MetaMask** – For wallet connection  
- **Sepolia Test Network** – For deploying and testing the smart contract  
- **Vercel** – For hosting the frontend  

## 📖 How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone [Insert GitHub Link]
   cd crypto-exchange-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=your_infura_project_id
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🛠 Smart Contract Deployment (Hardhat)
If you want to redeploy the smart contract:

1. **Navigate to the Smart Contract Folder:**
   ```sh
   cd smart-contract
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the Smart Contract:**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```
